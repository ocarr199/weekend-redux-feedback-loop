# PRIME FEEDBACK S.P.A.

This is an application that replicates similar functionality to the feedback website used at Prime Digital Academy. This is for gaging overall wellbeing and understanding of students and also keeping track of other comments students want to share.

This is a single page application that uses routes to change the content being displayed. This is achieved through Hashrouter. This project is made from javascript using the React framework. Redux is also used for holding the state of all of the feedback data before it is sent to the database. PostgreSQL is used for a database.
Axios is used to post to the database once the user has clicked submit on the review feedback page. Axios is also used to Get the data on the admin screen and to delete rows on the admin screen. Node js and express are used for the server with the assistance of express Router and pool to send data to the database. Material UI is used for styling buttons, textfields, tables and the navbar. It was also used for some functionality such as needing data before being able to move on to the next section (like in the feelings page). Structure and styling were based on HTML and CSS. 

This project was a lot of fun to make and thank you for checking it out!
